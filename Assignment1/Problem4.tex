\section{Problem 4: Relational calculus 1 (15 pts)}

\subsection{Description:}

\noindent Consider a system that associates active flights to airlines. The requirements of the system
are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Flights are unique.
  \item Each flight is associated to a single airline, e.g. AA333 is an American Airlines flight.
  \item The system can support new flights to be associated to an existing airline, or existing flights to be deleted.
  \item Airlines can have several active flights at any point in time.
\end{itemize}

\noindent We introduce types \emph{Flight} and \emph{Airline}. The model of the system is captured by variable
map, as shown below:\\

\[
maps = \\
\hspace{5mm} \{ \\
\hspace{10mm} AAA333 \mapsto \emph{American Airlines},\\
\hspace{10mm} AY29 \mapsto \emph{Finnair},\\
\hspace{10mm} TS261 \mapsto \emph{Air Transat},\\
\hspace{10mm} TS765 \mapsto \emph{Air Transat}\\
\hspace{5mm} \}
\]

\begin{enumerate}
  \item Is \emph{map} a binary relation? Explain.\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \item Is \emph{map} a function? Explain and if Yes, determine the type of the function.\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \item Define the precondition for operation \emph{add}, that adds a new flight-airline pair.\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \textbf{For Questions 4 and 5 assume the presence of the above precondition:}\\
  \item Provide two alternative definitions for the core functionality of operation \emph{add}.\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \textbf{For Questions 6 and 7 assume that the above precondition is removed:}\\
  \item What would be the result of calling operation \emph{add} with \emph{flight}? = \emph{TS765}, and \emph{airline}? = \emph{American Airlines}?\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \item What would be the result of calling \emph{add} with\
  \[
  \hspace{10mm} \emph{flight}? = AA333,\\
  \hspace{10mm} \emph{airline}? = Air Canada,
  \]
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \item Under what conditions, if any, can \emph{set union} serve as a mechanism to successfully add a new record into the database table? What error could possibly occur?\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
  \item Provide a definition for the core functionality of operation \textbf{delete} that erases a flight from \emph{map}, given the flight number.\\
  \noindent\underline{Solution:}\\
